<p>In this chapter, we will show you a complete sales flow, from lead to opportunity to quotation to sales order in a step-by-step scenario.</p>
<p>First you will get an explanation about the use case (what Thomas or one of his colleagues is supposed to do). Then the <em>Notes</em> will learn you how Thomas (or a colleague of his) enters the information in OpenERP CRM. For the simplicity of the use case, we will do all of the steps under the Admin user.</p>

<p>Your company is exhibiting at the &#8220;House &amp; Design&#8221; Fair in Paris and Thomas, a salesman of your company, meets lots of prospects during this event.
Because Luc, the Sales Manager, would like to know the return on investment from hiring a stand at this fair, he asks Thomas, who will be hosting this event, to make a &#8220;House &amp; Design&#8221; campaign.</p>

<p>On the business opportunity, the salesman should provide more information, such as the estimated income. Thomas indicates that the expected revenue would be 5,000.00€, and that the success rate of the opportunity at this stage is 20%.</p>
<p>Thomas sets Luc, the sales manager, as the person responsible to follow up the opportunity. He also sets the date for the next action and describes that he has to call the potential customer to plan a meeting with Luc, the sales manager.</p>

<p>From the opportunities screen, Thomas will click the first <cite>List</cite> view button to get an overview of several opportunities at a time. When Thomas wants more information about a specific opportunity, he will switch to <cite>Form</cite> view. Then Thomas decides he wants to see the opportunities in a graphical representation, so he clicks the <cite>Graph</cite> (3rd) button to display a graph with the opportunities expressed according to Category versus Expected Revenue.
He could choose to display the opportunities in <cite>Calendar</cite> view.
Thomas wants to see his meetings in a bar chart representation, and so he clicks the <cite>Gannt</cite> view button.
To see a process representation of his marketing campaign, he clicks the <cite>Diagram</cite> view button.</p>
<p>Please note that this is just an explanation of the different view buttons.</p>
