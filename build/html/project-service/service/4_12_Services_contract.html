<span id="index-0"></span><h1>Managing Service Contracts<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-service-contracts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Contracts can take different forms within OpenERP, depending on their nature. So you can have
several distinct types of service contracts, such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixed-price contracts,</li>
<li>cost-reimbursement contracts, invoiced when services are completed,</li>
<li>fixed-price contracts, invoiced monthly as services are carried out.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Contract Quotations</p>
<p>Some companies commit to contracts on the basis of a requested volume at a certain price for a
defined period.
In such a case, the contract is represented by a pricelist for that specific customer.</p>
<p class="last">The pricelist is linked in the <em class="guilabel">Sales and Purchases</em> tab of the <em class="guilabel">Customers</em> form,
so that it is brought up whenever anything is bought from or sold to this partner
(depending on whether it is a purchase or sales agreement).
OpenERP automatically selects the price based on this agreed pricelist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixed-price-contracts">
<h2>Fixed Price Contracts<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-price-contracts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fixed price contracts for the sale of services are represented in OpenERP by a Sales Order. In
this case, the supply of services is managed just like all other stockable or consumable products.</p>
<p>You can add new orders using the menu <em class="menuselection">Sales ‣ Sales ‣ Quotations</em>.</p>
<p>The new Sales Order document starts in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Draft</span> <span class="pre">Quotation</span></tt> state, so the estimate has no
accounting impact on the system until it is confirmed. When you confirm the order, your estimate
moves into the state <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Sale</span> <span class="pre">Order</span></tt> .</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/service_sale_workflow.png"><img alt="../../_images/service_sale_workflow.png" src="../../_images/service_sale_workflow.png" style="width: 639.65px; height: 297.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Process for handling a Sales Order</em></p>
</div>
<p>Once the order has been approved, OpenERP will automatically generate an invoice and/or a delivery
document proposal based on the parameters you set in the order.</p>
<p>The invoice will be managed by the system depending on the setting of the field <em class="guilabel">Shipping Policy</em> on the order&#8217;s second tab <em class="guilabel">Other Information</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em class="guilabel">Payment Before Delivery</em> : OpenERP creates an invoice in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Draft</span></tt> state.
Once this is confirmed and paid, the delivery is activated.</li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Invoice on Order After Delivery</em> : the delivery order is produced when the order is
validated. A draft invoice is then created when the delivery has been completed.</li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Shipping &amp; Manual Invoice</em> : OpenERP starts the delivery from the confirmation of
the order, and adds a button which you manually click when you are ready to create an invoice.</li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Invoice From The Delivery</em> : invoices are created from the picking stage.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note" id="index-1">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Delivery of an Order</p>
<p>The term &#8216;delivery&#8217; should be taken in the broadest sense in OpenERP.
The effect of a delivery depends on the configuration of the sold product.</p>
<p>If its type is either <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Stockable</span> <span class="pre">Product</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Consumable</span></tt>, OpenERP will make a request for it to be
sent for picking.
If the product&#8217;s type is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Service</span></tt>, OpenERP&#8217;s scheduler will create a task in the project management
system,
or create a subcontract purchase order if the product&#8217;s <cite>Procurement Method</cite> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Make</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Order</span></tt>.</p>
<p class="last"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Invoicing</span> <span class="pre">after</span> <span class="pre">delivery</span></tt> does as it says: invoicing for the services when the tasks have been
closed.</p>
</div>
<p>When you sign a new contract, you can just enter the order into the system and OpenERP will track
the order.</p>
<p>This works well for small orders. But for large valued service orders, you might want to invoice
several times through the contract, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>30% on order,</li>
<li>40% on completion,</li>
<li>30% one month after the system has gone into production.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case you should create several invoices for the one Sales Order. You have to do for this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do not handle invoicing automatically from the Sales Order but carry out manual invoicing instead,</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cost-reimbursement-contracts">
<h2>Cost-reimbursement Contracts<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-reimbursement-contracts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some contracts are not invoiced from a price fixed on the order but from the cost of the services
carried out. That is usually what happens in the building sector or in large projects.</p>
<p id="index-2">The approach you use for this is totally different because instead of using the sales order as the
basis of the invoice you use the analytic accounts. For this you have to install the module
<tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">hr_timesheet_invoice</span></tt>.</p>
<p>An analytic account is created for each new contract. The following fields must be completed in this
analytic account:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em class="guilabel">Partner</em> : partner associated with the contract,</li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Sale Pricelist</em>,</li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Invoicing</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selection of an invoicing rate is an indirect way of specifying that the project will be
invoiced on the basis of analytic costs. This can take different forms, such as delivery of
services, purchase of raw materials, and expense reimbursements.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-3"></span><div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Pricelists and Billing Rates</p>
<p>You can select a pricelist on the analytic account without having to use it to specify billing
rates.</p>
<p class="last">An example of this is a client project that is to be invoiced only indirectly from the analytic
costs.
Putting the pricelist on the analytic account makes it possible to compare the actual sales with
a best case situation where all the services would be invoiced.
To get this comparison you have to print the analytic balance from the analytic account.</p>

<p>Project Management and Analytic Accounts</p>
<p class="last"><em class="guilabel">Analytic Accounts</em> is only available once you have
installed the module <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">account_analytic_analysis</span></tt>.
It provides various global financial and operational views of a project manager&#8217;s projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixed-price-contracts-invoiced-as-services-are-worked">
<h2>Fixed-price Contracts Invoiced as Services are Worked<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-price-contracts-invoiced-as-services-are-worked" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For large-valued projects, fixed-price invoicing based on the sales order is not always appropriate.
In the case of a services project planned to run for about six months, invoicing could be based on
the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>30% on order,</li>
<li>30% at the project mid-point,</li>
<li>40% at delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an approach is often used in a company but there are other options. This method of invoicing
can pose many problems for the organization and invoicing of the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is extremely difficult to determine if the project is on track or not. The endpoint is fuzzy,
which can result in a tricky discussion with the client at the moment of final invoicing.</li>
<li>If the project takes more or less time than forecast, it will effectively result in under- or
over-invoicing during the project.</li>
<li>Whether you get a proper return can depend on the client. For example, if the client takes a long
time to sign off on project acceptance, you cannot invoice the remaining 40% even though you might
have supplied the agreed service properly.</li>
<li>The account manager and the project manager are often different people.
The project manager has to
alert the account manager about the moment that the client can be invoiced, but that moment can easily be
forgotten or mistaken.</li>
<li>The project can be fixed for service costs but have agreed extras, such as reimbursement for
travel expenses. Invoicing from the order does not adapt well to such an approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenERP provides a third method for invoicing services that can be useful on long projects. This
consists of invoicing the project periodically on the basis of time worked up to a fixed amount that
cannot be exceeded. At the end of the project, a final invoice or a credit note is generated to meet
the total amount of value fixed for the project.</p>
<p>To configure such a project you must set an invoicing rate, a pricelist and a maximum amount on the
analytic account for the project. The services are then invoiced throughout the project by the
different project or account managers, just like projects that are invoiced by time used. The
managers can apply a refund on the final invoice if the project takes more time to complete than
permitted under the contract.</p>
<p>When the project is finished you can generate the closing invoice.
This automatically calculates the final balance of the bill, taking the amounts already charged into account.
If the amount already invoiced is greater than the maximum agreed amount, then OpenERP generates a draft credit note.</p>
<p>This approach offers many advantages compared with the traditional methods of invoicing in phases
for fixed-price contracts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts are invoiced in the same way, which makes
the company&#8217;s invoicing process quite simple and systematic even when the projects are mixed.</li>
<li>Everything is invoiced on the basis of worked time, making it easy to forecast invoicing from
plans linked to the different analytical accounts.</li>
<li>This method of proceeding educates project managers just as much as the client because refunds
have to be given for work done if the project slips.</li>
<li>Invoicing follows the course of the project and avoids a supplier&#8217;s dependence on the goodwill of
the client in approving certain phases.</li>
<li>Invoicing of expenses follows the same workflow and is therefore very simple.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Negotiating contracts</p>
<p class="last">In contract negotiation, invoicing conditions are often neglected by the client.
So it can often be straightforward to apply this method of invoicing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contracts-limited-to-a-quantity">
<h2>Contracts Limited to a Quantity<a class="headerlink" href="#contracts-limited-to-a-quantity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-5">Finally, certain contracts are expressed in terms of a quantity rather than a fixed amount. Support
contracts comprising a number of prepaid hours are a case in point. To generate such contracts in
OpenERP you should start by installing the module <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">account_analytic_analysis</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Then you can set a maximum number of hours for each analytic account. When employees enter their
time worked on the support contract in the timesheets, the hours are automatically deducted from the
maximum set on each analytic account.</p>
<p>You must also name someone in the company responsible for renewing expired contracts. They become
responsible for searching through the list of accounts showing negative remaining hours.</p>
<p>The client contract can be limited to a certain quantity of hours, and it can also be limited in
time. For that, you set an end date for the corresponding analytic account.</p>
