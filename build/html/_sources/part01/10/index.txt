Search Box in OpenERP

Lets say if you are on the Product list, when you enter some search criteria in to the search box, it give you all the possibilities related to to that string. As an example you can see that we can search for all product where name contains "computer" or browse the all the product who belongs to the "computer" category.

.. note::
	If you enter two search criteria in search box, apply one after other, it will apply ``and`` operator between those criteria.
	
Quick Filters
-------------
Enter search criteria in to the search box always performs quick filters. Some of the document have defined ``Filters`` to filter the data effectively. Like searching for the all the product which can be sold it will be difficult to derived using advance filters. All those basic search criteria can be defined as filters during the development and we can use those quickly from the advance search options.

To get the advance search options, click on the down-arrow on search box appear on the right side. On click on that you will be able to see all the possible advance filters available for products.

If you select multiple filters, like the quick text filters, it will apply ``and`` operator between those selected advance filters.


Group By
~~~~~~~~
Data can be grouped in List, Kanban, or Groups Views. In List view you can have a flexibility to have unlimited levels of grouping while other views there is a limitations with grouping. Grouping is applied based on series of clicks performed on the group options. Like among two groups options ``Category`` and ``Default Unit of Measure Type`` available but it will apply first depends on what you select first. 

* Product by Category and Default Unit of Measure Type - If you select first ``Category`` and then ``Default Unit of Measure Type``
* Product by Default Unit of Measure Type and Category  - If you select first ``Default Unit of Measure Type`` and then ``Category``

Advance Search
--------------
To perform more advance search which are not available with Quick Search or Filters like select product whose Sale price in between 50 to 500. We can perform these kind of search with advance search and save them using Save advance search option.
While working with advance search we can define search operator and conditions between two conditions. If you add more then one conditions in single search it always be treated with ``OR`` operator. 

So, If you want to apply ``AND`` operator while working with Advance Search after each advance search option, apply and perform advance search again.
