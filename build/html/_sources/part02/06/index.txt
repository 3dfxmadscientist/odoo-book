Send Invoice to Customer & Register Payment
===========================================
Based on the confirmed sale order we  can generate the invoice and send it to the customer. However it is depends on the invoice policy available on the sales order. When you have not installed Warehouse ``stock`` module you can create an invoice from the Sales order according to the default invoice policy.
