<h2>Goods Receipts<a class="headerlink" href="#goods-receipts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In OpenERP, you have the choice between three ways to receive goods from suppliers.</p>
<p>The first method is to manually enter the information in the incoming shipment. To receive the products through this method, you have to go to <em class="guilabel">Incoming Shipments</em> section (Warehouse -&gt; Receive/Deliver by Orders -&gt; Incoming Shipments), click Create and then you enter the information about the receipt.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/stock_getting.png"><img alt="../_images/stock_getting.png" src="../_images/stock_getting.png" style="width: 844.5px; height: 494.25px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Manual Data Entry for Product Receipt</em></p>
</div>
<p>The second method is to receive products from a generated incoming shipment. To achieve the reception using this method, you have to go to <em class="guilabel">Incoming Shipments</em> section. You will find the list of waiting incoming shipments.</p>
<p>The third method is to receive products by waiting products without looking at the shipment document.You can validate the reception by products in <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Receiver/Deliver Products ‣ Incoming Products</em> . With this method, you will be able to receive one product, regardless of the document which is attached to this product.</p>
<div class="section" id="receipt-of-a-supplier-order-by-purchase-order">
<h3>Receipt of a Supplier Order by Purchase Order<a class="headerlink" href="#receipt-of-a-supplier-order-by-purchase-order" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you use Purchase Orders in OpenERP, product receipts are automatically generated by the system when the
purchase order is confirmed. You do not have to enter any date, just confirm that the quantities ordered match the
quantities received.</p>
<p>Incoming Shipments forms are automatically prepared by OpenERP from the purchase management
process. You will find a list of all the awaited receipts in the menu <em class="menuselection">Warehouse
‣ Receive/Deliver By Orders ‣ Incoming Shipments</em>. Use the order number or the supplier name to find the
right goods receipt form for confirmation of a goods-in. This approach enables you to control
quantities received by referring to the quantities ordered.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/stock_picking_in_tree.png"><img alt="../_images/stock_picking_in_tree.png" src="../_images/stock_picking_in_tree.png" style="width: 843.75px; height: 270.75px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Incoming Shipments from Purchase management</em></p>
</div>
<p>You can also do goods-in data entry manually if there is no order, in Incoming Shipments menu by clicking the <cite>Create</cite> button.</p>
<p>A new goods-in data entry form opens. Enter the supplier in the <em class="guilabel">Supplier</em> field
and type the reference number from your supplier in the field <em class="guilabel">Source Document</em>.</p>
<p>Now in Product tab, click on Add an item and select Product &amp; quantity. In that form the source location is already completed by default because of your supplier selection.
You should then give the destination location where you will place the products. For example, enter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Stock</span></tt>.
At this stage, you can set a Serial number for traceability (this function will be described later in
this chapter, so leave this field empty for the moment).</p>
<p>Once the form has been completed, you can click on <cite>save</cite> button &amp; close that wizard.</p>
<p>Now in <cite>Additional info</cite> tab, You can select the Delivery method either partial or All at once. Confirm this incoming shipment.</p>
<p>Next go to Incoming Products, in list view you will find your created incoming shipment, open that order, you can find buttons on that form, <em class="guilabel">Process Partially</em> and <cite>Process Entirely</cite>. (Process Partially button available only if you have select delivery method partially in <cite>Additional info</cite> tab of Incoming shipment)</p>
<p>If you click , the wizard open and seems like following figure, for example 18 quantity of Datacard product,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="figure align-center">

<p class="caption"><em>Confirm partial reception</em></p>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After doing of partial process (example 9), another object will be generated with a back order reference equal to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Reference</span></tt> number of the incoming shipment already confirmed.
Now you can find in list view of Incoming product seems like following figure,</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Process a Partial Incoming Shipment</em></p>

<p>Once the rest of the order has arrived and has been processed, both orders will be merged.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Form for Entering Goods received from a Supplier Order</em></p>
</div>
<p>The products then arrive in stock and should reflect the quantities shown on the product form.</p>
<p>In the <cite>Incoming Shipments</cite> form, the field <em class="guilabel">Invoice Control</em> lets you influence the way you
send invoices to suppliers. If this is set to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">To</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">invoiced</span></tt>, a supplier invoice will now be
generated automatically in the draft state, based on the goods received. Your accountant then has to
confirm this pre-invoicing once the supplier&#8217;s invoice is received. This enables you to verify that
the invoiced quantities correspond to the quantities received.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Print the Picking Slip</p>
<p>In order to print the picking Slip of an incoming shipment, select the incoming shipment of which you need

<p class="last">This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Delivery</span> <span class="pre">Slip</span></tt> is available in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal</span> <span class="pre">Moves</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Delivery</span> <span class="pre">Orders</span></tt> sections.</p>

<p>In case you received damaged or wrong products, you can return them to the supplier. In the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Incoming</span> <span class="pre">shipment</span></tt>
form, click the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Return</span> <span class="pre">Products</span></tt> button. A window will open that lets you choose the invoicing
process to follow. Once you click <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Process</span></tt>, a stock move is generated with the same reference number
and <cite>return</cite> to specify that this is a return move.</p>

<h3>Receipt of a Supplier Order by Product<a class="headerlink" href="#receipt-of-a-supplier-order-by-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The approach shown above is very useful if goods receipts correspond to the original orders. If your suppliers
deliver items that do not necessarily coincide with the orders, however, it is easier to work by products received
rather than by orders.</p>
<p>From this version on, you can also handle receptions by product, even from List view. Go to <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Receiver/Deliver Products ‣ Incoming Products</em>.</p>
<p>Filters allow you to easily select receipts to be done, and so on. One way to quickly receive products is to Group by <cite>Product</cite>,`Picking`,etc and select <cite>To Do</cite>.</p>
<p>This is very useful functionality when your supplier sends the goods for several purchase orders at a time. You can now just receive the products, regardless of the purchase order they come from, simply by clicking the green arrow at the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>The List view offers great flexibility and allows you to rapidly incoming products by keeping full functionality! Of course, you can handle both partial and complete receptions, and you can add information about the Serial Numbers and packs.</p>

<p>You should install the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">stock_location</span></tt> module (from the list of modules) if routing products to customers, from suppliers or in your warehouse is determined by the identity of the product itself.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Managing the Paths from one Location to Another in a Product Form (In Inventory tab)</em></p>
</div>
<p>This will let you configure logistics rules individually for each product. For example, when a specific product
arrives in stores, it can automatically be sent to quality control. In this case, it has to be configured as a Push Flow
with rules in the Product form. The fields that make up those rules are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Source Location</strong>: the rule only applies if a product comes from this location,</li>
<li><strong>Destination Location</strong>: the rule only applies if a product ends up in this location,</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Move</strong>: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Automatic</span> <span class="pre">Move</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Manual</span> <span class="pre">Operation</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Automatic</span> <span class="pre">No</span> <span class="pre">Step</span> <span class="pre">Added</span></tt>,</li>
<li><strong>Delay (days)</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>: a free text field which will be included in the automatic stock move proposed by OpenERP.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main logistic flows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Push Flow</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pull Flow</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><cite>Push</cite> flows are useful when the arrival of certain products in a given location should always be followed by a
corresponding move to another location, optionally after a certain delay. The original Warehouse application already
supports such Push flow specifications on the Locations themselves, but these cannot be refined per product.
<cite>Pull</cite> flows are a bit different from Push flows, in the sense that they are not related to the processing of product
moves, but rather to the processing of procurement orders. What is being pulled is a need, not directly products.
You will now see some examples of using these locations and logistics by product through Pushed Flows for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A rentable product,</li>
<li>A product bought in China, following its freight by ship from port to port,</li>
<li>A product that you want to send to quality control before putting it in stocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will develop the third scenario: <strong>the quality control</strong>.</p>
<p>You can configure the system to put a given product in the Quality Control bay automatically when it arrives in
your company. To do that, you just configure a rule for the product to be placed in the Quality Control location
rather than the Input location when the product is received from the supplier.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<p>Once this product has been received, OpenERP will automatically manage the request for an internal movement
to send it to the Quality Control location. If you want to do this automatically without having to
confirm it, in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Automatic</span> <span class="pre">Move</span></tt> field, select <cite>Automatic Move</cite> or <cite>Automatic No Step Added</cite>.</p>
<p>With the configuration described in the table above, you will have to confirm the stock move manually once you
have received the goods.</p>

<h2>Shipping of Goods<a class="headerlink" href="#shipping-of-goods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the same way as delivering goods, you can ship goods in three different ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>manually enter data,</li>
<li>deliver goods according to a sales order,</li>
<li>deliver goods by product.</li>
</ul>
<p id="index-0">Everything about goods receipt can also be done manually in the same way for a customer delivery. This time, use
the automated product delivery processes based on customer orders. Install the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">sale</span></tt> module , so that you can proceed further in this section of the chapter.</p>
<p>Now create a new sales order from the menu <em class="menuselection">Sales ‣ Sales ‣ Sales Orders</em>.
Enter the following data in this order:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em class="guilabel">Shop</em> : <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Your</span> <span class="pre">Company</span></tt></li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Customer</em> : <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Agrolait</span></tt></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have already seen that OpenERP shows the available product stock in list view. The real stock is equal to the virtual stock because you have nothing to deliver to customers and you are not waiting for any of these products to be received into stock. The salesperson then has
all the information needed to take orders efficiently.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Entering an Order for Three Data Card</em></p>
</div>
<p>Then confirm the quotation to convert it to an order. If you return to the product form, you will see
the virtual stock is now smaller than the real stock.</p>
<p>Start the scheduler through the menu <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Schedulers ‣ Run Schedulers</em>. Its
functionality will be detailed in <em class="xref std std-ref">ch-mnf</em>. This manages the reservation of products and places orders
based on the dates promised to customers, and the various internal lead times and priorities.
Three products will be reserved in the order that you created, so they cannot be sold to another customer.</p>

This means that you do not have to start the scheduler or wait for its periodical start time.</p>
</div>
<p>Now have a look at the list of deliveries waiting to be carried out using the menu
<em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Receiver/Deliver By Orders ‣ Delivery Orders</em>. You find a line

<p class="caption"><em>Items on a Customer Order</em></p>
</div>
<p>You can also confirm a customer delivery from a confirmed Sales Order.
When you click the <em class="guilabel">Process</em> button of <cite>Outgoing Deliveries</cite>, a window opens where you can
enter the quantities actually delivered. If you enter a value less than the forecasted one, OpenERP
automatically generates a partial delivery note and a new order for the remaining items. For this
exercise, just confirm all the products.</p>
<p>However, if you want to look at a partial shipping, an example will be developed at the end of this section.</p>
<p>If you return to the list of current orders, you will see that your order has now been marked as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Done</span></tt>.</p>

<h3>Just In Time<a class="headerlink" href="#just-in-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, scheduling starts automatically once a day. You should make this
scheduling execute overnight to ensure that the system does not slow down under a heavy load of scheduling when
you are also trying to use it interactively.</p>
<p>To set the start time for the scheduler, go to the menu
<em class="menuselection">Setting ‣ Technical ‣ Scheduler ‣ Scheduled Actions</em>. Select the rule
called &#8216;Run mrp scheduler&#8217; and modify the date and time of the next execution.</p>
<p id="index-3">Some companies want to plan orders progressively as they are entered, so they do not wait until
procurement orders are planned the next day. Install the module <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">mrp_jit</span></tt> to handle this. Once the module is installed, each requirement (that could result in a Production or Purchase Order)
will be planned in real time as soon as it has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Then if you make a sales order with a product that is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Make</span> <span class="pre">To</span> <span class="pre">Order</span></tt>, the quotation request to a
supplier will immediately be generated.</p>
<p id="index-4">This mode does not always makes sense. Each order is processed immediately when confirmed. So if an order
is to be delivered in three months, the scheduler will reserve goods in stock for each order once
it has been confirmed. It would have been more sensible to leave these products available for other
orders.</p>
<p>If a Purchase Order&#8217;s <em class="guilabel">Invoicing Control</em> is configured <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">From</span> <span class="pre">Order</span></tt>,
the scheduler will immediately create the corresponding supplier quotation request. It might have been better to delay it for several weeks, if
you could have used the lead time to group the purchase with other future orders.</p>
<p>So the negative effects of working with the Just in Time module are:</p>

<h2>Logistics Configuration through Advanced Routes<a class="headerlink" href="#logistics-configuration-through-advanced-routes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To configure your logistics for advanced push and pull, you need to install <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">stock_location</span></tt> module as explained before. A complete scenario will be developed at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>This module supplements the <em>Warehouse</em> application by adding support for location paths per product, effectively implementing Push and Pull inventory flows.</p>
<p>Typically this could be used to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Manage product manufacturing chains,</li>
<li>Manage default locations per product,</li>
<li>Define routes within your warehouse according to business needs, such as:<ul>
<li>Quality Control</li>
<li>After Sales Services</li>
<li>Supplier Returns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help rental management, by generating automated return moves for rented products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this module is installed, an additional <cite>Logistics Flows</cite> tab appears in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Product</span></tt> form, allowing you to add <em>Push and Pull</em> flow specifications.</p>
<div class="section" id="push-flow">
<h3>Push Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#push-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Push flows are useful when the arrival of certain products in a given location should always be followed by a corresponding move to another location, optionally after a certain delay.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Product</p>
<p class="last">The core <em>Warehouse Management</em> application already supports such Push Flow specifications on the Locations, but these cannot be refined per product.</p>
</div>
<p>A push flow specification indicates which location is chained with another location, as well as the parameters used. As soon as a given quantity of products is moved to the source location, a chained move is automatically foreseen according to the parameters set on the flow specification (destination location, delay, type of move, journal, etc.) The new move may be processed automatically, or may require a manual confirmation, according to what you have defined.</p>
<p>Suppose whenever the demo data product <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPUi5</span></tt> enters the <cite>Stock</cite> location, it first has to be moved to the <cite>Quality Control</cite> location in order to check the quality.</p>
<p>Look up the product <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPUi5</span></tt> using the menu <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Products ‣ Products</em>.</p>
<p>To have OpenERP accomplish this move automatically, you have to configure the <em>Push</em> flow as follows:</p>

<h3>Pull Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#pull-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Pull</em> flows are a bit different from Push flows, in the sense that they are not related to the processing of product moves, but rather to the processing of procurement orders. What is being pulled is a <em>need</em>, not directly products.</p>
<p>A classical example of a Pull flow is when you have an Outlet company, with a parent Company that is responsible for the supplies of the Outlet.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>[ Customer ] &lt;- A - [ Outlet ]  &lt;- B -  [ Holding ] &lt;- C - [ Supplier ]</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Demo Data</p>
<p class="last">In our demo data example, the Outlet Company is Your Company Chicago shop, while Your Company is the parent company.</p>
</div>
<p>When a new procurement order A (resulting from the confirmation of a Sales Order, for example) is created in the Outlet (Your Company, Chicago shop), it is converted into another procurement B (through a Pull flow of the &#8216;move&#8217; type) requested from the Holding. When procurement order B is processed by the Holding company (Your Company), and if the product is out of stock, it may be converted into a Purchase Order (C) from the Supplier (Push flow of the &#8216;Buy&#8217; type). The result is that the procurement order, the need, is pushed all the way between the Customer and Supplier.</p>
<p>Technically, Pull flows allow to process procurement orders differently, not only depending on the product being considered, but also depending on which location holds the &#8220;need&#8221; for that product (i.e. the destination location of that procurement order).</p>
<p>To explain a pull flow for the product <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPUa8</span></tt>, we first have to configure the Reordering rules of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPUa8</span></tt> for the company <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Your</span> <span class="pre">Company</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Your</span> <span class="pre">Company,</span> <span class="pre">Chicago</span> <span class="pre">shop</span></tt> using the menu <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Configuration ‣ Reordering Rules</em>.</p>

<p>The procurement method determines how the product will be replenished:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em class="guilabel">Make to Stock</em>: your customers are supplied from available stock. If the quantities in stock are
too low to fulfil the order, a Purchase Order (according the minimum stock rules) will be generated in order
to get the products required. Example: a classic distributor.</li>
<li><em class="guilabel">Make to Order</em>: when a customer order is confirmed, you procure or manufacture
the products for this order. A customer order &#8216;Make to Order&#8217; will not modify stock in the medium term
because you restock with the exact amount that was ordered. Example: computers from a large supplier
assembled on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>You find a mix of these two modes used for the different final and intermediate products in most
industries. The procurement method shown on the product form is a default value for the order,
enabling the salesperson to choose the best mode for fulfilling a particular order by varying the
sales order parameters as needed.</p>

product can be either manufactured internally or bought from a supplier.</p>
<p>These three fields (<em class="guilabel">Supply Method</em>, <em class="guilabel">Procurement Method</em>, <em class="guilabel">Product
Type</em>) determine the system&#8217;s behaviour when a product is required. The system will generate
different documents depending on the configuration of these three fields when satisfying an order, a
price quotation to a supplier or a manufacturing order.</p>
<p>OpenERP manages both stockable products and services. A service bought from a supplier in
<em class="guilabel">Make to Order</em> mode, will generate a subcontract order from the supplier in question.</p>

<h3>Units of Measure<a class="headerlink" href="#units-of-measure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenERP supports several units of measure. Quantities of the same product can be expressed in
several units of measure at once. For example, you can buy grain by the tonne and resell it by kg.
You just have to make sure that all the units of measure used for a product are in the same units of
measure category.</p>

convert from one unit of measure to another as long as they are in the same category.</p>

<p>Depending on the table above, you have 1Kg = 1000g = 0.001 Tonnes. A product in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Weight</span></tt>
category could be expressed in Kg, Tonnes or Grammes. You cannot express it in hours or pieces, for example.</p>
<p>Use the menu <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Configuration ‣ Units of Measure</em>
to define a new unit of measure.</p>
<p>In the definition of a Unit of Measure, you have a <em class="guilabel">Rounding precision</em> factor which shows how
amounts are rounded after the conversion. A value of 1 gives rounding to the level of one unit. 0.01
gives rounding to one hundredth.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Secondary Units</p>
<p>OpenERP supports double units of measure.
Notice however that the default unit of measure and the purchase unit of measure have to be in the same category.
Only the sales unit of measure may be in a different category.</p>
<p class="last">This is very useful in the agro-food industry, for example: you sell ham by the piece, but invoice
by the Kg.
A weighing operation is needed before invoicing the customer.</p>
</div>
<p>To activate the management options for double units of measure, you have to change configuration from Settings -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Warehouse .</p>
<p>In this case, the same product can be expressed in two units of measure belonging to different
categories for sales and stock/purchase. You can then distinguish between the unit of stock management (the piece) and the unit
of invoicing or sales (kg) in the Sales tab of Product form.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/UOM_UOS.png"><img alt="../_images/UOM_UOS.png" src="../_images/UOM_UOS.png" style="width: 897.0px; height: 205.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Secondary Unit of Measure</em></p>
</div>
<p>In the product form you can set one unit of measure for sales and stock management, and one
unit of measure for purchases (in Procrument tab of Product form).</p>
<p>For each operation on a product, you can use another unit of
measure, as long as it can be found in the same category as the two units already defined. If you
use another unit of measure, OpenERP automatically handles the conversion of prices and quantities.</p>
<p>So if you have 430 Kg of carrots at 5.30 EUR/Kg, OpenERP will automatically make the conversion if
you want to sell in tonnes – 0.43 tonnes at 5300 EUR / tonne. If you had set a rounding factor of
0.1 for the <em class="guilabel">tonne</em> unit of measure, OpenERP will tell you that you have only 0.4 tonnes
available.</p>

<div class="section" id="packaging">
<h3>Packaging<a class="headerlink" href="#packaging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The packaging allows you to ship products in several ways. For example, you can ship goods by boxes or by
pallets.</p>
<p>At first, you have to define possible packaging. To define the packaging, go to <em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Configuration ‣ Products ‣ Packaging</em> and click <em class="guilabel">Create</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/packaging.png"><img alt="../_images/packaging.png" src="../_images/packaging.png" style="width: 846.75px; height: 164.25px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Packaging definition</em></p>
</div>
<p>To complete the creation of a new packaging, you have to give it a name and a type. Different types are
available in OpenERP: <em class="guilabel">Box</em>, <em class="guilabel">Pack</em>, <em class="guilabel">Pallet</em> and <em class="guilabel">Unit</em>.</p>
<p>Once all packaging is defined, you can attach the packaging to your products through the following menu:
<em class="menuselection">Warehouse ‣ Products ‣ Products</em>. (Open Product Form view and go to Sales Tab in the last you will find line of packing)</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
