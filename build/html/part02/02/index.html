</div>
<div class="section" id="communicate-on-leads">
<h2>Communicate on Leads<a class="headerlink" href="#communicate-on-leads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new feature in OpenERP 7.0, Social Enterprise Communications provides all the communications related to the documents available on the same documents so you don;t need any email client or mail folders to search for the communications related to the leads.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/lead-emails1.png" src="../../_images/lead-emails1.png" />
<p>Communications on Leads</p>
<p>Once you define Incoming and Outgoing email servers on the settings, you can start receiving and sending email on every document which is enterprise social enabled, in OpenERP it called chatter when you will see followers who will get intimations on their dashboard or OpenERP wall depending on the channel they are following. You can directly send an email or internal notes for the future reference along with the document attached in chatter.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifying Lead</strong></p>
<img alt="../../_images/lead-state.png" src="../../_images/lead-state.png" />
<p>States and other Operations on Lead</p>
<p>When you get positive reply of your email on leads, it shows customer&#8217;s interested to work with us and finally you can convert it in to opportunity through &#8220;Convert to Opportunity&#8221; and it will automatically change state from New -&gt; Opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracking-leads">
<h2>Tracking Leads<a class="headerlink" href="#tracking-leads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can groups the leads and analyze to understand who is overloaded, which team have not enough leads or where are new countries where you started new business ? I thinks those are very important questions to control and take the management decision quickly.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/lead-groups.png" src="../../_images/lead-groups.png" />
<p>Leads Tracking</p>
<p>You can generate lots of analytical reports directly on screen in list view using the Groups, filters under Advance Search operations.</p>
