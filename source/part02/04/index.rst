Opportunity Form View

In OpenERP, many information you get on the opportunity comes from lead like Subject, Email, Phone, Internal Nots and all communication, etc..

A good salesman does not forget to put the Expected Revenue, Probability to close the deal and Expected date to close the deal on Opportunity when you assigned to him / her.

**Next Action & Date**

Salesman can put the next action date and action to perform on that date to progress on the opportunity. Salesman can easily check TODOs on their opportunity pipes to  work on every day based on the next actions.

**Expected Revenue & Probability**

The revenue can be generated by proposing the products for which prospect is interested is usually encode as a expected revenue and probability is calculated based on the stage of the opportunity.

Probability of the opportunity can be changed automatically if you choose to do so, based on your stage configuration. You may found the configuration of the stages under Sales → Lead & Opportunities → Stages and you change the required configurations.

Expected closing date is simply based on the sales cycle of the product you selling.
